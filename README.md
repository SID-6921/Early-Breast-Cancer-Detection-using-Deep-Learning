# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

This repository contains code to preprocess and analyze breast cancer CBIS-DDSM and histopathology images, train various deep learning models (CNN, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, MobileNet), and evaluate their performance. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of these models in classifying breast cancer images into benign and malignant categories, ultimately identifying the most effective model for breast cancer detection using histopathological images.
